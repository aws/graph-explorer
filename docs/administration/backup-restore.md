# Backup and Restore

This guide covers how to backup and restore Graph Explorer configuration data.

## Backup Graph Explorer Data

Inside of Graph Explorer there is an option to export all the configuration data
that Graph Explorer uses. This data is local to the user's browser and does not
exist on the server.

To gather the config data:

1. Launch Graph Explorer
2. Navigate to the connections screen
3. Press the "Settings" button in the navigation bar
4. Select the "General" page within settings
5. Press the "Save Configuration" button
6. Choose where to save the exported file

This backup can be restored using the "Load Configuration" button in the same
settings page.
