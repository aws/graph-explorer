# Connecting to BlazeGraph

- Build and run the Docker container as normal, then add a connection with **Connection method** set to **Through the Graph Explorer server**. BlazeGraph doesn't answer queries from web pages, so **Directly from your browser** can't reach it.
- If using Docker, ensure that the container running Graph Explorer can properly access the container running BlazeGraph. You can find documentation on how to connect containers via [Docker networks](https://docs.docker.com/network/).
