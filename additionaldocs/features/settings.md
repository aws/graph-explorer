# Settings UI

## General Settings

- **Default Neighbor Expansion Limit:** This setting will allow you to enable or
  disable the default limit applied during neighbor expansion. This applies to
  both double click expansion and the expand sidebar. This setting can be
  overridden by a similar setting on the connection itself.
- **Save Configuration:** This action will export all the configuration data
  within the Graph Explorer local database. This will not store any data from
  the connected graph databases. However, the export may contain the shape of
  the schema for your databases and the connection URL.
- **Load Configuration:** This action will replace all the Graph Explorer
  configuration data you currently have with the data in the provided
  configuration file. This is a destructive act and can not be undone. It is
  **strongly** suggested that you perform a **Save Configuration** action before
  performing a **Load Configuration** action to preserve any existing
  configuration data.
