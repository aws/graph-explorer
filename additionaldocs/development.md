## Development
This developer README details instructions for building on top of the graph-explorer application, or for configuring advanced settings, like using environment variables to switch to HTTP.

### Requirements
- pnpm >=8.15.6
- node >=20.12.2

#### Node Version
Ensure you are running the correct Node version. If you are using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can simply do:

```bash
nvm use
```

Otherwise, use whatever method you use to install [Node v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

#### Node Corepack
[Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) is used to ensure the package manager used for the project is consistent.

```bash
corepack enable
```

### Supported Graph Types
- Labelled Property Graph (PG) using Gremlin or openCypher
- Resource Description Framework (RDF) using SPARQL 

### Run in development mode

Install any missing or updated dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the development servers.

```bash
pnpm start
```

Launch your web browser of choice and navigate to

```
http://localhost:5173
```

At this point, Graph Explorer should be successfully running and it is asking you for connection details. This part is specific to your personal setup.


### Build for production
- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm build`
- `dist` folder is created in the graph-explorer directory.
- Serve the static site using the method of your choice,
for example, using `serve` npm package.

### Managing dependencies

If you need to add, remove, or update a dependency you can easily do so from the root folder in the CLI:

```bash
# Adding a package for the react app
pnpm ui add react

# Adding a dev only dependency for the server app
pnpm server add -D jest
```

#### Preparation of a release
This repository is composed by 2 packages and a mono-repository structure itself. Then, you need to take into account 3 different `package.json` files:
- `<root>/package.json` is intended to keep the dependencies for managing the repository. It has utilities like linter, code formatter, or git checks.
- `<root>/packages/graph-explorer/package.json` is the package file that describes the UI client package.
- `<root>/packages/graph-explorer-proxy-server/package.json` is the package file for the node server which is in charge of authentication and redirection of requests.

Each of these `package.json` files has an independent `version` property. However, in this project we should keep them correlated. Therefore, when a new release version is being prepared, the version number should be increased in all 3 files.
Regarding the version number displayed in the user interface, it is specifically extracted from the `<root>/packages/graph-explorer/package.json`. file

### Environment variables

You can find a template for the following environment variables at `/packages/graph-explorer/.env`. All variables described below are optional and will default to the given values.

- `GRAPH_EXP_ENV_ROOT_FOLDER`: Base folder for the public files. By default, `/` (`string`). 
- `GRAPH_EXP_CONNECTION_NAME`: Default connection name. Blank by default (`string`).
- `GRAPH_EXP_CONNECTION_ENGINE`: Default connection query engine work with the instance. By default, `gremlin` (`gremlin | sparql`).
- `GRAPH_EXP_HTTPS_CONNECTION`: Uses the self-signed certificate to serve the Graph Explorer over https if true. By default `true` (`boolean`).
- `PROXY_SERVER_HTTPS_CONNECTION`: Uses the self-signed certificate to serve the proxy-server over https if true. By default `true` (`boolean`).

### Using self-signed certificates with Docker

- Self-signed certificates will use the hostname provided in the `docker run` command, so unless you have specific requirements, there are no extra steps here besides providing the hostname.
- If you would like to modify the certificate files, be aware that the Dockerfile will make automatic modifications on run, in lines 8 and 9 of the [entrypoint script](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/blob/main/docker-entrypoint.sh), so you will need to remove these lines.
- If you only serve one of either the proxy server or Graph Explorer UI over an HTTPS connection and wish to download from the browser, you should navigate to the one served over HTTPS to download the certificate.
- The other certificate files can also be found at /packages/graph-explorer-proxy-server/cert-info/ on the Docker container that is created. 

### Using Self-signed certificates on Chrome

For browsers like Safari and Firefox, [trusting the certificate from the browser](../README.md/#https-connections) is enough to bypass the “Not Secure” warning. However, Chrome treats self-signed certificates differently. If you want to use a self-signed certificate on Chrome **without** the “Not Secure” warning and you do not have your own certificate, or one provided by Let’s Encrypt, you can use the following instructions to add the root certificate and remove the warning. These instructions assume you’re using an EC2 instance to run the Docker container for Graph Explorer.

1. After the Docker container is built and running, open a terminal prompt and SSH into your proxy server instance (e.g., EC2).
2. Get the container ID by running `sudo docker ps`
3. Copy the root certificate file (rootCA.crt) from the container to EC2: `sudo docker cp {container_id}:~/graph-explorer/packages/graph-explorer-proxy-server/cert-info/rootCA.crt ~/rootCA.crt`
4. Exit SSH session 
5. Copy the root certificate file from EC2 to your local machine (where you would run Graph Explorer on Chrome): `scp -i {path_to_pem_file} {EC2_login}:~/rootCA.crt {path_on_local_to_place_file}` For example, `scp -i /Users/user1/EC2.pem ec2-user@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:~/rootCA.crt /Users/user1/downloads`
6. After copying the certificate from the container to your local machine’s file system, you can delete the rootCA.crt file from the EC2 file store with `rm -rf ~/rootCA.crt`
7. Once you have the certificate, you will need to trust it on your machine. For MacOS, you can open the Keychain Access app. Select System under System Keychains. Then go to File > Import Items... and import the certificate you downloaded in the previous step. 
8. Once imported, select the certificate and right-click to select "Get Info". Expand the Trust section, and change the value of "When using this certificate" to "Always Trust". 
9. You should now refresh the browser and see that you can proceed to open the application. For Chrome, the application will remain “Not Secure” due to the fact that this is a self-signed certificate. If you have trouble accessing Graph Explorer after completing the previous step and reloading the browser, consider running a docker restart command and refreshing the browser again.

### Troubleshooting
- If you need more detailed logs, you can change the log level from `info` in the default .env file to `debug`. The logs will begin printing the error's stack trace.
- If the Graph Explore crashes, you can recreate the container or run `pnpm start` inside of `/packages/graph-explorer`.
- If the proxy-server crashes, you can recreate the container or run `pnpm start` inside of `/packages/graph-explorer-proxy-server`
- If the proxy-server fails to start, check that the provided endpoint is properly spelled and that you have access to from the environment you are trying to run in. If you are in a different VPC, consider VPC Peering.
