## Launching Graph Explorer using Amazon SageMaker

Graph Explorer can be hosted and launched on Amazon SageMaker Notebooks via a lifecycle configuration script. To learn more about lifecycle configurations and how to create one, see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html).

You can use the provided sample lifecycle configuration, [`install-graph-explorer-lc.sh`](install-graph-explorer-lc.sh), or create your own shell script. If using the sample lifecycle, you should also create an IAM role with a policy containing the permissions described in either [`graph-explorer-neptune-db-policy.json`](graph-explorer-neptune-db-policy.json) or [`graph-explorer-neptune-analytics-policy.json`](graph-explorer-neptune-analytics-policy.json), depending on the service used.

After you have created the lifecycle configuration and IAM role, you can attach them to a new or existing SageMaker notebook instance, under `Notebook instance settings` -> `Additional configuration` -> `Lifecycle configuration` and `Permission and encryption` -> `IAM role`, respectively.

When the notebook has been started and is in "Ready" state, you can access Graph Explorer by adding the `/proxy/9250/explorer/` extension to the base notebook URL. The Graph Explorer link should look something like:

```
https://graph-explorer-notebook-name.notebook.us-west-2.sagemaker.aws/proxy/9250/explorer/
```
