- **Fixed** issue where the edge's display name value was not being displayed
  properly ([#716](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/716))

## Release 1.12.0

This release is mostly a maintenance release, with a few new features and bug
fixes.

### Consistent node and edge information

The biggest noticeable change is the consistency of node and edge information
across the app. Previously, the node and edge information was rendered
differently in the search results, node details, edge details, and expand
options. Now, they are all consistent, with the same information displayed.

These changes improve the support for multiple node labels and date values in
Gremlin.

### All changes

- **Improved** consistency of rendering node information across search results,
  node details header, edge details header, and expand options header
  ([#697](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/697))
- **Improved** edge properties in the details sidebar, which now includes the
  source and target vertex IDs and types
  ([#698](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/698))
- **Fixed** date rendering on Gremlin connections
  ([#698](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/698))
- **Fixed** a bug where the automatic open details feature would not open the
  details sidebar when selecting nodes
  ([#679](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/679))
- **Improved** styling on checkboxes across the app, and specifically the export
  options popover and entity filters sidebar
  ([#676](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/676))
- **Improved** styling on icon buttons
  ([#674](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/674),
  [#675](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/675),
  [#683](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/683))

  ([#707](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/707))

  ([#696](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/696))
- **Consolidated** logic around the display of nodes and edges to a single
  location for simplicity and consistency
  ([#698](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/698))
- **Updated** dependencies, including Node v22
  ([#680](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/680))

## Release 1.11.0

This release includes a big change to search, improvements to the Docker image
size and security, and as always, there are many additional small fixes and
improvements.

### Search Sidebar

With this release, we've moved search out of the top navigation bar and in to
the sidebar. When new users open Graph Explorer for the first time, they will be
greeted with a set of search results ready to be added to the graph and
explored.

For existing users, you'll benefit from a better experience with search. Your
filters will remain active as you navigate around and it will do its best to
keep your attribute selection when you change the node type. There's also a new
"Add All" button, when you want to add all the search results to the graph with
a single click.

### All Changes

- **Improved** search discoverability and ergonomics by moving the UI in to the
  sidebar ([#665](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/665),
  [#669](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/669),
  [#670](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/670))

  sets ([#658](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/658))

  row ([#657](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/657))

  clicked ([#650](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/650))

  remaining in the image
  ([#616](https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer/pull/616))

  more
